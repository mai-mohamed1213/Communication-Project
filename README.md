# Communication-Project
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview:

This repository contains the complete implementation and documentation for a course project in ECE 252: Fundamentals of Communication Systems at Ain Shams University. The project explores both analog and digital communication systems, including the simulation and analysis of signal behavior using Octave. Key components include:
Analog Communication: Fourier analysis, low-pass filtering, and implementation of DSB-SC and SSB modulation as part of a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) system.
Digital Communication: Design and comparison of line coding schemes such as Polar NRZ and AMI, and development of a full Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation and coherent receiver system.
All simulations were developed using Octave, and the results include both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. This project demonstrates practical applications of core communication concepts and signal processing techniques.
